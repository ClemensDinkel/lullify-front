        is to create a magic portal for you to watch videos for
        children from all around the web and create your own playlists
        with as few clicks as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create and play your own playlists and relax. It's literally
        kids' play.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can watch all provided videos and create temporary
        playlists without even signing up. But behold: as soon as you
        log out, your portal will close. If you want Lullifey to
        maintain your portal, sign up!
